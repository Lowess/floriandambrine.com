#### The Project

Icinga is a scalable and extensible monitoring system which checks the availability of resources, notifies users of outages and provides extensive BI data.

I automated Icinga with Ansible so that it is synchronized with the AWS EC2 Cloud. Each time a new server starts, the Icinga server triggers a recording process in order to register this new server and to monitor running services.
