#### TIAD (The Incredible Automation Day) Conférence

TIAD offers the time, the tools & space to understand Automation and all the theory & practice around it. Thanks to inspiring speakers, live demos and interactive workshops, we give you the chance to LIVE the Automation your own way. Dedicated to IT professionals, TIAD is an inclusive event mixing developers & ops engineers, freelances & students, large companies & startups.

GumGum's operations team manages over 800 EC2 instances using around 100 Ansible roles that touch technologies like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Storm, and Kafka among others.

Today’s operation team uses automations to provision, configure and build AWS AMIs and production clusters. Automations have become a critical resource we need to make 100% reliable.The talk I held for the TIAD allowed me to share what I have learned about setting up test infrastructure for configuration management software like Ansible based on Docker and Jenkins. Here are the different links to follow in order to dive into the subject:
