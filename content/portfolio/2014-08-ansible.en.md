#### Le Projet

I have been involved in building from scratch, a new automation plateform based on Ansible. All existing automations developed by Chef have been migrated to Ansible.

This new plateform allows you to automate new services such as Tomcat, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Storm, Zookeeper, Exhibitor, Uptime or Logstash.

The provisioning step is fully integrated with Ansible (security groups creation, RAID volume setup, cluster restart)
