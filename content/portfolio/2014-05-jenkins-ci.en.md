#### Le Projet

I have been involved in replacing the current continuous integration server named Bamboo (an Atlassian product) by an open source technology, Jenkins. Indeed Jenkins allows you to manage a large number of projects and control the deployment process (running Unit tests, Artifactory deployment, S3 deployment).

Today this server is capable of managing dozens of projects simultaneously. Thanks to a couple of plugins, the design of the server has been reviewed to stick at the Company colors.
