#### The Project

After about a year of life of this blog, I decided to re-develop it with Python. Indeed it was sometimes painful to get back to front-end technologies like PHP or Symfony given that my day to day job.

I started working with Flask a micro-framework well integrated with several modules like Babel for the translation, WtfForms which generates forms based on data structures or even SqlAlchemy for forms validation.

Once more, I am using Ansible to release this blog. No manual intervention is required.
