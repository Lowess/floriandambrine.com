#### The Project

As a part of my assistant engineer internship at the Snecma (Safran group company), I worked on the structuring and the setting up of a data base which was designed to deals with exploitation results of rocket engine tests. This project led me to work with data classification, and the structuring of all the data in a data base in order to protect their integrity and their safety. This data base is used by a software named Vortex, which was developed by myself, allowing to feat the requirements (data extraction, graphs viewing and customizing, data importation, â€¦).
