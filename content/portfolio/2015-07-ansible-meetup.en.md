#### The Project

After about a year working with Ansible, I decided to present and share my knowledge with this technology during a public Meetup with the Ansible-Los-Angeles group in at the Santa Monica Public Library.

On July 8th, I had a chance to talk about our use of Ansible at GumGum. GumGum's operations team manages over 500 EC2 instances using over 60 Ansible roles that touch technologies like Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Storm, and Kafka among others. The talk included a brief overview of Ansible along with plenty of great content from working with Ansible in the trenches, followed by Q and A.

For more details on the subject you can find the slides on:
