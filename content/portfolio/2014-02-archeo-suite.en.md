#### The Project

The Archeo Suite was developed for the archaeological service of Amiens. That one includes two software: ArcheoExtractor and ArcheoExif. ArcheoExtractor is mainly designed to extract photo's paths and photo's names to a CSV file or an SQLite database. As for ArcheoExif, it allows extracting EXIF data (focal length, brand camera, shooting date, …) from pictures contained in the user selection folders. These information can be exported to a CSV file, into a SQLite database, or an XML file in order to interface with FileMaker 12.
