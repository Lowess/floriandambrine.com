I am a Freelance DevOps Engineer graduated from UTC (University of Technology of Compi√®gne) in 2014.

Today, I am mainly working for GumGum, a digital marketing platform for the visual web based in Santa Monica (CA), where I did a 6 months internship before being graduated.

Over all, I love evolving with cutting edges technologies in order to tackle challenges in a world which moves fast!
